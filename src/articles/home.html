    <h1>This site is a single HTML file, some CSS, but <em>no JavaScript</em></h1>
    <p>I’ve written it to explore CSS features that could be used instead of JavaScript libraries, and to familiarize myself with CSS animations.</p>
    <p>Along the way, I documented my discoveries and the patterns I’ve used. This site is both an example and documentation.</p>
    <h2>Demos/Docs/Patterns</h2>
    <p>Each page describes a certain technique, and links to the relevant part of the code for this site to see it in action</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#changing-pages">Changing pages SPA-style</a></li>
      <li><a href="#transitions-in-and-out">Transitioning in and out of pages</a></li>
      <li><a href="#keeping-it-dry">DRYing up complex queries</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Inspired By</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use of <code>:target</code> described in <a target='_blank' href="http://youmightnotneedjs.com">You Might Not Need JS</a></li>
      <li>Use of CSS custom properties / variables described in <a target='_blank' href="https://css-tricks.com/css-attr-function-got-nothin-custom-properties/">The CSS attr() function got nothin’ on custom properties</a></li>
      <li>CSS animation ideas in <a target='_blank' href="http://animista.net/">Animista</a> (a beautiful interface for exploring animations and generating sample CSS)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>I don't believe we should start building static websites this way.</p>

    <h3>Then What's The Point?</h3>
    <p>
      By doing this exercise of writing an interactive site without JavaScript, I may find in the future that I need less JavaScript to do the same thing --
      because there's more that you can do with CSS than I previously thought.
