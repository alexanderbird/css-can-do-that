    <h1>This site is a single HTML file, some CSS, but <em>no JavaScript</em></h1>
    <p>I’ve written it to explore CSS features that could be used instead of JavaScript libraries, and to familiarize myself with CSS animations.</p>
    <p>Along the way, I documented my discoveries and the patterns I’ve used. This site is both an example and documentation.</p>
    <h2>Demos/Docs/Patterns</h2>
    <p>Each page describes a certain technique, and links to the relevant part of the code for this site to see it in action</p>

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>I don't believe we should start building static websites this way.</p>

    <h3>Then What's The Point?</h3>
    <p>
      By doing this exercise of writing an interactive site without JavaScript, I may find in the future that I need less JavaScript to do the same thing --
      because there's more that you can do with CSS than I previously thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I'm most likely to actually do with this is to pass state from JavaScript to CSS via custom properties,
      and then use that state to adjust CSS properties -- as opposed to calculating CSS properties in JavaScript
      and setting them as inline styles. I've explored that idea more in
      <a href='https://codepen.io/alexanderbird/pen/yGVMqo'>this CSS scroll animation codepen</a>.
