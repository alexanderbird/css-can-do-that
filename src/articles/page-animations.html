    <h1>Page Animations</h1>
    Consider...
    <div class='side-by-side'>
      <pre>
        <div class='page' id='page-1'>
          Page 1 content
        </div>
        <div class='page' id='page-2'>
          Page 2 content
        </div>
        <div class='page' id='home-page'>
          Home page content
        </div>
      </pre>
      <pre>
        #home-page,
        .page:target {
          animation: fade-in 1s;
        }

        .page:target ~ #home-page,
        .page:not(#home-page):not(:target) {
          animation: fade-out 1s;
        }

        @keyframes fade-in {
          from { opacity: 0; } 
          to { opacity: 1; }
        }

        @keyframes fade-out {
          from { opacity: 1; }
          to { opacity: 0; }
        }
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      When a page is no longer <code>:target</code>ed, it animates out. The next page that is <code>:target</code>ed
      is, in turn, animated in. (Refer to <a href='#changing-pages'>Changing Pages</a> for an explanation of the
      <code>#home-page</code> stuff.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem</strong>: when the page first loads, all but one page are not <code>:target</code>ed, so they
      animate out. Except that the page must be visible to animate out. The result is that every page is visible
      and overlaid one above the other, while all but one animates out.
      (<a href='#demo-of-transition-bug'>demo of this behaviour</a>.)
    </p>
    <div class='side-by-side'>
      <div>
        <p>
          One approach to deal with this is to set a CSS custom property to <code>hidden</code> until all the
          animations are complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the page loads, <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code> is <code>hidden</code>.
          After 1s (or whatever an appropriate delay is based on the speed of the exit animations), we run the
          <code>initialize</code> animation which unsets <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code>
        </p>
      </div>
      <pre>
        :root {
          --hidden-while-initializing: hidden;
          animation: initialize 0s ease-in-out 1s both;
        }

        @keyframes initialize {
          to {
            --hidden-while-initializing: unset;
          }
        }
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      My first attempt involved using the approach described in
      <a href='#keeping-it-dry'>DRYing up complex queries</a> to change the value of
      <code>animations</code> based on the value of <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code>.
      (To do this, <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code> would have to start as <code>none</code>
      instead of <code>hidden</code>)
    </p>
    <p>
      That can't work, because as soon as the value of <code>animations</code> changes, the new animation runs --
      so all we're doing is delaying that flash of all the pages animating out.
    </p>
    <div class='side-by-side'>
      <div>
        <p>Instead, change the <code>@keyframes</code> based on the value of <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code>.</p>
        <p>While initializing, the page is hidden (<code>visibility: hidden</code>). Then, it's <code>visible</code></p>

      </div>
      <pre>
        @keyframes fade-out {
          from {
            visibility: var(--hidden-while-initializing, visible);
            opacity: 1;
          }

          to {
            visibility: var(--hidden-while-initializing, visible);
            opacity: 0;
          }
      </pre>
    </div>
