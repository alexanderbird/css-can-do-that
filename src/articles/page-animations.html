    <h1>Page Animations</h1>
    Consider...
    <div class='side-by-side'>
      <pre>
        <div class='page' id='page-1'>
          Page 1 content
        </div>
        <div class='page' id='page-2'>
          Page 2 content
        </div>
        <div class='page' id='home-page'>
          Home page content
        </div>
      </pre>
      <pre>
        #home-page,
        .page:target {
          animation: fade-in 1s;
        }

        .page:target ~ #home-page,
        .page:not(#home-page):not(:target) {
          animation: fade-out 1s;
        }

        @keyframes fade-in {
          from { opacity: 0; } 
          to { opacity: 1; }
        }

        @keyframes fade-out {
          from { opacity: 1; }
          to { opacity: 0; }
        }
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      When a page is no longer <code>:target</code>ed, it animates out. The next page that is <code>:target</code>ed
      is, in turn, animated in. (Refer to <a href='#changing-pages'>Changing Pages</a> for an explanation of the
      <code>#home-page</code> stuff.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Problem</strong>: when the page first loads, all but one page are not <code>:target</code>ed, so they
      animate out. Except that the page must be visible to animate out. The result is that every page is visible
      and overlaid one above the other, while all but one animates out.
      (<a href='#demo-of-transition-bug'>demo of this behaviour</a>.)
    </p>
    <div class='side-by-side'>
      <div>
        <p>
          One approach to deal with this is to set a CSS custom property to <code>hidden</code> until all the
          animations are complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the page loads, <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code> is <code>hidden</code>.
          We run the <code>initialize</code> animation to unset <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code> after a delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>initialize</code> animation does nothing for the duration of the animation,
          and sets the <code>to</code> values at the end of the animation. (It behaves this way because of
          the <code>steps(1, end)</code> timing function, which divides the animation into a single step. 
          <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/single-transition-timing-function#The_steps()_class_of_timing_functions'>
          MDN docs on <code>steps()</code> as a timing function</a>
        </p>
      </div>
      <pre>
        :root {
          --hidden-while-initializing: hidden;
          animation: initialize 1s steps(1, end);
        }

        @keyframes initialize {
          to {
            --hidden-while-initializing: unset;
          }
        }
      </pre>
    </div>
    <div class='side-by-side'>
      <div>
        <p>
          Note that at the time of writing this this seems to only work on Chrome &mdash; as discussed in this 
          <a href='https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/issues/137'>WC3 spec discussion</a>, custom properties
          cannot be interpolated in animations. Once the <code>@property</code> rule is supported (not even on caniuse
          yet, it seems <a href='https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/issues/4420'>GitHub request to ad it to caniuse</a>),
          that ought to make it possible to interpolate the values in animations.
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn't include this JavaScript alternative in this demo so that I could say "zero JavaScript" on the 
          landing page, but if you can't wait for the full browser support you can replace the <code>initialize</code>
          animation with the following JavaScript.
        </p>
      </div>
      <pre>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
          const initializationDelay = 1000
          setTimeout(() => {
            const rootStyle = document.documentElement.style
            rootStyle.removeProperty('--hidden-when-initializing')
            // also you can use:
            //   rootStyle.setProperty('--property-name', 'value')
            // if there are custom properties whose values you want to
            // change after the initialization delay
          }, initializationDelay)
        })
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      My first attempt involved using the approach described in
      <a href='#keeping-it-dry'>DRYing up complex queries</a> to change the value of
      <code>animations</code> based on the value of <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code>.
      (To do this, <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code> would have to start as <code>none</code>
      instead of <code>hidden</code>)
    </p>
    <p>
      That can't work, because as soon as the value of <code>animations</code> changes, the new animation runs --
      so all we're doing is delaying that flash of all the pages animating out.
    </p>
    <div class='side-by-side'>
      <div>
        <p>Instead, change the <code>@keyframes</code> based on the value of <code>--hidden-while-initializing</code>.</p>
        <p>While initializing, the page is hidden (<code>visibility: hidden</code>). Then, it's <code>visible</code></p>

      </div>
      <pre>
        @keyframes fade-out {
          from {
            visibility: var(--hidden-while-initializing, visible);
            opacity: 1;
          }

          to {
            visibility: var(--hidden-while-initializing, visible);
            opacity: 0;
          }
      </pre>
    </div>
