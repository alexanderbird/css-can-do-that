# Motivation
When I don't read api docs, the code I write ends up way more compliated than it needs to be --
I build something from scratch because I didn't know it was supported out of the box.

So it is for CSS and JavaScript -- I tend to use JavaScript for *as much* as possible, and CSS for *as little* as possible. 

But are there things that I am tempted to use a JavaScript library for that are more appropriate to write in CSS?

## This experiment/demo
Can I build a...
  - spa-style static website (one html file entry point)
  - with transitions between pages
  - without using any JavaScript?

## What I've done
  - [changing pages](#changing-pages)
  - [âš¡ transitions in and out](#transitions-in-and-out)
  - [pattern: CSS if/else](#css-if-else)
